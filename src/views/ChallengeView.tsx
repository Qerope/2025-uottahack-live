      title="Joint Human-Machine System"
      challenge={(<span>As automation and AI become more pervasive, finding the right balance between human involvement and machine support is critical‚Äîespecially in fields like Air Traffic Control, where automation has the potential to reduce human skills and situational awareness over time. In the event of an incident, the human may be held accountable for an outcome that resulted from significant automation input. Tetris, a game requiring quick decisions and sharp thinking, offers a great analogy for air traffic control. Your challenge is to design an AI or automation system that helps a human player achieve the highest possible Tetris score. The automation should have limitations that require the human to step in and make key decisions, ensuring the human remains meaningfully involved and accountable for the result.</span>)}
