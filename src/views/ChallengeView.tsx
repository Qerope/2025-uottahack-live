In the event of an incident, the human may be held accountable for an outcome that resulted from significant automation input. Tetris, a game requiring quick decisions and sharp thinking, offers a great analogy for air traffic control. Your challenge is to design an AI or automation system that helps a human player achieve the highest possible Tetris score. The automation should have limitations that require the human to step in and make key decisions, ensuring the human remains meaningfully involved and accountable for the result.

        title="Rapid Analysis of Breached Account Data"
        challenge={(<span>The Challenge As part of our early warning application, we are required to quickly analyze large amounts of data leaked on various underground channels. To speed up this process, we are looking for an application that can parse, store, and enrich the intercepted data, making it searchable and eventually integrating it with other applications. The breached data we are capturing includes usernames, passwords, and URLs. To efficiently identify specific breached data, we need to parse large amounts of raw text data, ingest it into a database, and enrich it with as much additional information as possible. The challenge for this hackathon is to process very large text files containing breach data, parse the contents, store the parsed data in a MySQL database, enrich it with additional details, and make it searchable. This will help us quickly share breach information with affected organizations to initiate incident response.
          <br /> <br />
          The Details Breached data is frequently shared on underground channels and sold to various parties, including threat actors such as carders or ransomware actors. As part of our services, we intercept these breaches, identify high-risk accounts (such as those related to hospitals' VPNs, charitable organizations, and customer accounts), and prevent further attacks on their networks. The amount of data we intercept has now outpaced our simple scripts, and we need a more efficient solution to make our early warning application faster and more effective.
           <br /> <br /> 
           Your goal Create an application that can: <br />
          * Parse breach data from large text files. <br /> 
          * Store it in a relational database (MySQL). <br /> 
          * Enrich the data with additional information. <br /> 
          * Allow users to search the database and filter breach data. <br /> <br /> 
          Inputs: <br />
          You will be provided with large text files containing anywhere between 7,000 and 25,000,000 lines. Each line contains a URL, a username, and a password in the following format: URI USERNAME PASSWORD <br /> The URIs in these files may be valid, invalid, or improperly formatted.</span>)}
